You are a 3D shape editing expert. You are given a 3D $shape_class composed of cuboidal parts with relations between them, and a user's edit request in natural language. Given a list of part-level edits, you must determine if they completely fulfill the user's edit request.

## Shape Specification

Your input is a $shape_class. The part-hierarchy of the $shape_class is described as follows:

$shape_specification
## User's Edit Request

$edit_request

## List of Part-level Edits

$all_edits_in_detail

$unedited_parts

## Output specification

You must specify the `edit_complete` boolean variable in a code snippet in the following format:

```python
edit_complete = ... # must be an boolean
```

### Steps for Determining Edit Completeness

1. **Review Edit Request**: Summarize the edit request in your own words.

2. **Review Planned Edits**: Summarize how the planned edits support the edit request.

3. **Review Unedited parts**: Carefully analyze the unedited parts. Did the edit request explicitly require them to be edited? If even a single part which should have been edited is not edited, then the list of edits is incomplete. But if none of the unedited parts have been explicitly requested to be edited, then the list of edits is complete.

### Guidelines

1. **Analytical Approach**: Carefully follow the steps above explaining the logic behind your choices.

2. **Code Format**: Specify the `edit_complete` variable in a single Python code snippet, strictly adhering to the specified format.

3. **Edit Completeness Priority**: Prioritize enabling the requested edit. As a secondary factor, also consider maintaining the shape's integrity. If either of these cannot be achieved, then the list of edits is incomplete. 

4. **No Backtracking**: Ignore if the edit on a part is not the correct one. Only consider if the part has been edited or not.

5. **Unedited Parts**: Remember that currently the unedited parts are properly supporting the shape's integrity. Only consider if the edit request explicitly requires them to be edited.

Now, please specify the `edit_complete` variable by following the instructions above.

You are a 3D shape editing expert. You are given a 3D $shape_class composed of cuboidal parts, and a user's edit request in natural language. You are given an incomplete list of part-level edits. Your goal is to define a single additional new edit to help fulfill the user's edit request.

## Shape Specification

Your input is a $shape_class. The part-hierarchy of the $shape_class is described as follows:

$shape_specification
## User's Edit Request

$edit_request

## Incomplete List of Edits

The following part-level edits have been defined already:

$all_edits_in_detail

$unedited_parts

## Output specification

Specify the `new_edit` variable in python using the API defined below. The `new_edit` should be specified in a code snippet in the following format:

```python
new_edit = ... # must be created via the API
```
The `new_edit` variable must be created using the following API:

$API

### Steps for Determining New Edit

1. Carefully analyze the unedited parts. Did the edit request explicitly require any of them to be edited? Parts which should have been edited but are not edited are candidate parts for the new edit. Select one of these parts to edit.

2. For the identified part, identify edit classes from the API which adhere to the edit request.

3. If there are multiple edit classes which adhere to the edit request, first consider the effect of editing the identified part with each candidate class. Then, based on this analysis, select the edit class that is the most appropriate.

4. Now, for the selected edit class, consider each of its attributes one-by-one, and specify what they should be, and why. Then, use functions such as `center`, `face_center`, `edge_center`, `direction`, `RightUnitVector` etc. to define these parameters.

### Guidelines

1. **Analytical Approach**: Provide a step-by-step rationale for the primary edit, explaining the logic behind your choices.

2. **Code Format**: Specify the new edit in a executable Python code snippet, strictly adhering to the specified API format. Remember to specify only a single new edit with the `new_edit` variable.

3. **Function Use**: Employ functions like `center` and `face_center` to define the primary edit precisely.

4. **Part Selection**: Use the `shape.get(label)` function to access the part with label `label`, where the label is the path from the root part to the part to be accessed (e.g., `left_front_leg = shape.get("legs/leg_front_left")`)

5. **Parts are Cuboids**: Remember that all the parts are cuboids.

6. **Scaling / Rotating Parts** When scaling or rotating parts, always carefully consider the value of the `origin` parameter.

7. **Global Directions**: Remember that all the directional variables "front", "back", "left", "right", "up", "down" are defined with respect to the global coordinate system. Therefore, the bottom face of the seat approximately faces the 'down' direction and the top face of the seat faces the 'up' direction approximately.

Now, please specify a single new edit by following the instructions above."""
